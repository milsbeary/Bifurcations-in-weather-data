# Bifurcations-in-weather-data
Some of the code and results generated during the attempts to complete the project. The project ulimatly failed as we could not get our LSTM model to accuratly identify heatwaves and cold snaps after early warning signals of bifurcations, but the code generated contains a lot of algorithms that could be usesful for other projects that use simmilar data or methods
